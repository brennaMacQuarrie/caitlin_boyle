                <p><span>I’m Caitlin- taker of pictures and sloth enthusiast. Currently based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, but who doesn’t love a good road trip, right?</span><br>
                <span>I have been professionally behind the lens for about 10 years, but my family can attest to me being a photography addict well into early childhood. I made it ‘LinkedIn official’ however when I graduated from the Alberta University of Arts in 2012.</span><br>
                <span>I don’t discriminate against taking photos of pretty much anything, but I have a special place in my heart for people, animals and still life. One of my favorite parts of my job is the people I get to meet and work with, so feel free to reach out if you have a project you would like to work on together or if you just want to chat!</span></p>
